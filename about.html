        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Lucas, I'm a Master of Cyber Security student specialising in Digital Forensics. 
           <br><br>
           I decided to start this website to share my learning journey. It will be an aggregation of all my thoughts, not only limited to the field of cyber security.
           <br><br>
           I am by no means a cyber security expert, I'm far from it. Nevertheless, the goal is to get one step closer everyday.
           <br><br>
           I'm interested in reading, philosophy, programming, cyber security and personal development in general.
